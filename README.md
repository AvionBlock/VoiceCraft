> [!WARNING]
> For Windows users. since it has been more than 6 months since v1.0.7 released, the certificate expired meaning that to install the application properly, you will need to turn back the time on your device. We are working hard on v1.1.0 to resolve this issue. If you wish to help speedup the development then please join the discord to talk to me directly for guidance.

## Project Description
VoiceCraft proximity chat is a VOIP program developed on .NET 9.0 MAUI framework and .NET 9.0 Console, started by SineVector241, this project enables Voice Proximity chat for the game Minecraft on the bedrock platform which gives a more immersive, communicative experience. This project will also expand into supporting more platforms such as IOS and MAC devices. This project only allows for a self-hosted framework giving the owners more control on how they want it to be setup however the project may also expand into allowing multiple server instances on a single server that does not require a self-hosted framework and allows other users to host for other Minecraft server owners.
