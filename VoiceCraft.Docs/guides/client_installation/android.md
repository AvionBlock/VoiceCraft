Go to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AvionBlock/VoiceCraft/releases/latest) page and download the file named
`VoiceCraft.Client.Android.<Architecture>.zip`.

The \<Architecture\> to choose and download needs to be the architecture of your CPU, the most common one is arm64.

# Installing

open the file then open the file ending in `.apk` within the extracted folder. This will open the android app installer
(which may vary between devices and OS's) and click on the `install`button. If a Google play protect screen comes up,
you can click on `More Info` and click on `Install Anyways` (wording may vary).
