Welcome to the VoiceCraft documentation!

> [!WARNING]
> THIS DOCUMENTATION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR V1.1.0!

## Why use VoiceCraft

VoiceCraft is a customizable cross-platform proximity chat solution for minecraft bedrock edition allowing modifications of the core functions through the API, allowing streaming of custom audio through addons into VoiceCraft's system and advanced use of it's filters and effects. VoiceCraft's system also is based on linear proximity voice chat for vanilla bedrock servers as opposed to other alternative proximity chat solutions such as skoice which requires discord and a java server.

VoiceCraft ALSO **DOES NOT** REQUIRE YOU TO SIGN IN WITH YOUR MINECRAFT ACCOUNT, however it requires that you either use a custom linking method provided by a custom addon or by the `VoiceCraft.Basic` addon.
